An overview of our Hair-GANs architecture. The generator and the discriminator are trained in conjunction.

## ./Ori_Conf_from_Img
This folder contains the code for orientation and confidence map generation with an image as input. Please begin from the "toRunConfidenceBuider" to track the implimentation of [Unsupervised Texture Segmentation Using Gabor
